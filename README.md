## AlgoVis

Overview

Welcome to AlgoVis, an interactive platform designed to explore the beauty and complexity of algorithms. This project aims to simplify the understanding of complex algorithms through engaging and interactive visualizations. Whether you're a student, educator, or enthusiast, AlgoVis offers a unique learning experience to deepen your algorithmic knowledge.
Features

  - Interactive Algorithm Visualizations: Dive into the world of algorithms with interactive tools that make learning both fun and informative.
  - Graph Algorithms: Explore fundamental graph algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Algorithm. These visualizations are particularly useful for understanding the flow and mechanics of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.
  - Sorting Algorithms: Get hands-on with sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of how different sorting algorithms operate and their efficiency.

Usage

To start exploring, simply navigate to the desired algorithm section on the website. Each section provides interactive controls to start, pause, and reset the visualizations. You can also adjust parameters like transition speed to suit your pace of learning.
